# Springboard Data Science Career Track
This is the repository for the work, exercises and analysis related to the [Springboard Data Science Career Track program](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track). The capstone projects for the course can be found in separate repos and are no longer hosted here (the first capstone can be found [here](https://github.com/pjandir/CapstoneProject1)). The table below shows the mini-reports, projects, and exercises I have completed so far in the program.
